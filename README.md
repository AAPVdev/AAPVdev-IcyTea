# ðŸ›  Installation Guide (For Developers)

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Android Studio**: A powerful IDE for Flutter development. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Flutter SDK**: The open-source framework for building natively compiled applications. [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Git**: A version control tool to clone the repository. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/noise-monitoring-app.git
   cd noise-monitoring-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Next, fetch the necessary dependencies using Flutterâ€™s package manager:
   
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set Up Android Emulator or Device**  
   If you plan to run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device, ensure that Android Studio is properly set up to run emulators or connect your device via USB. You can verify your connected devices with:
   
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

4. **Run the App**  
   To build and run the app on your emulator or device, execute:
   
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

5. **Testing the App**  
   If youâ€™re making changes, you can use Flutterâ€™s hot reload feature to see the changes live in your app without restarting it:
   
   ```bash
   flutter hot reload
   ```

6. **Building the App**  
   When youâ€™re ready to create a release build for the app, you can run:
   
   ```bash
   flutter build apk
   ```

   Or, for an iOS build (if applicable):
   
   ```bash
   flutter build ios
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, consider the following:

- **Ensure all dependencies are up to date**: Run `flutter upgrade` to update Flutter and its dependencies.
- **Check for any missing environment variables**: If Flutter commands arenâ€™t recognized, ensure your systemâ€™s PATH includes the Flutter SDK.
- **Emulator Issues**: If you encounter issues with the Android emulator, check if virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
